# Face-Generation


Defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The aim is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project is broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, I was able to visualize the results of trained Generator to see how it performs; the generated samples looked like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
